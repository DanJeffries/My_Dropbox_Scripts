      "    -----\n",
      "    The main function is Bio.SeqIO.parse(...) which takes an input file handle\n",
      "    (or in recent versions of Biopython alternatively a filename as a string),\n",
      "    and format string.  This returns an iterator giving SeqRecord objects:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    >>> from Bio import SeqIO\n",
      "    >>> for record in SeqIO.parse(\"Fasta/f002\", \"fasta\"):\n",

      "    \n",
      "    Note that the parse() function will invoke the relevant parser for the\n",
      "    format with its default settings.  You may want more control, in which case\n",
      "    you need to create a format specific sequence iterator directly.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Input - Single Records\n",
      "    ----------------------\n",
      "    If you expect your file to contain one-and-only-one record, then we provide\n",
      "    the following 'helper' function which will return a single SeqRecord, or\n",
      "    raise an exception if there are no records or more than one record:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    >>> from Bio import SeqIO\n",
      "    >>> record = SeqIO.read(\"Fasta/f001\", \"fasta\")\n",
      "    >>> print(\"%s %i\" % (record.id, len(record)))\n",
      "    gi|3318709|pdb|1A91| 79\n",
      "    \n",
      "    This style is useful when you expect a single record only (and would\n",
      "    consider multiple records an error).  For example, when dealing with GenBank\n",
      "    files for bacterial genomes or chromosomes, there is normally only a single\n",
      "    record.  Alternatively, use this with a handle when downloading a single\n",
      "    record from the internet.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    However, if you just want the first record from a file containing multiple\n",
      "    record, use the next() function on the iterator (or under Python 2, the\n",
      "    iterator's next() method):\n",
      "    \n",
      "    >>> from Bio import SeqIO\n",
      "    >>> record = next(SeqIO.parse(\"Fasta/f002\", \"fasta\"))\n",
      "    >>> print(\"%s %i\" % (record.id, len(record)))\n",
      "    gi|1348912|gb|G26680|G26680 633\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The above code will work as long as the file contains at least one record.\n",
      "    Note that if there is more than one record, the remaining records will be\n",
      "    silently ignored.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "    Input - Multiple Records\n",
      "    ------------------------\n",
      "    For non-interlaced files (e.g. Fasta, GenBank, EMBL) with multiple records\n",
      "    using a sequence iterator can save you a lot of memory (RAM).  There is\n",
      "    less benefit for interlaced file formats (e.g. most multiple alignment file\n",
      "    formats).  However, an iterator only lets you access the records one by one.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    If you want random access to the records by number, turn this into a list:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    >>> from Bio import SeqIO\n",
      "    >>> records = list(SeqIO.parse(\"Fasta/f002\", \"fasta\"))\n",
      "    >>> len(records)\n",
      "    3\n",
      "    >>> print(records[1].id)\n",
      "    gi|1348917|gb|G26685|G26685\n",
      "    \n",
      "    If you want random access to the records by a key such as the record id,\n",
      "    turn the iterator into a dictionary:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    >>> from Bio import SeqIO\n",
      "    >>> record_dict = SeqIO.to_dict(SeqIO.parse(\"Fasta/f002\", \"fasta\"))\n",
      "    >>> len(record_dict)\n",
      "    3\n",
      "    >>> print(len(record_dict[\"gi|1348917|gb|G26685|G26685\"]))\n",
      "    413\n",
      "    \n",
      "    However, using list() or the to_dict() function will load all the records\n",
      "    into memory at once, and therefore is not possible on very large files.\n",
      "    Instead, for *some* file formats Bio.SeqIO provides an indexing approach\n",
      "    providing dictionary like access to any record. For example,\n",
      "    \n",
      "    >>> from Bio import SeqIO\n",
      "    >>> record_dict = SeqIO.index(\"Fasta/f002\", \"fasta\")\n",
      "    >>> len(record_dict)\n",
      "    3\n",
      "    >>> print(len(record_dict[\"gi|1348917|gb|G26685|G26685\"]))\n",
      "    413\n",
      "    >>> record_dict.close()\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Many but not all of the supported input file formats can be indexed like\n",
      "    this. For example \"fasta\", \"fastq\", \"qual\" and even the binary format \"sff\"\n",
      "    work, but alignment formats like \"phylip\", \"clustalw\" and \"nexus\" will not.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    In most cases you can also use SeqIO.index to get the record from the file\n",
      "    as a raw string (not a SeqRecord). This can be useful for example to extract\n",
      "    a sub-set of records from a file where SeqIO cannot output the file format\n",
      "    (e.g. the plain text SwissProt format, \"swiss\") or where it is important to\n",
